# ðŸŒˆ Color Combos ðŸŒˆ

## Inspiration
[randoma11y](https://www.randoma11y.com/#) exposes a neat collection of color combinations, but only
one at a time, in no particular order. However, they DO expose an API for accessing their data.

## Goal
Choosing a color palette for your design can be pretty difficult. We [humans can perceive MILLIONS](https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-vision/color-and-vision-matters) of colors. Now that's a lot
of options for a decision we'd rather not spend hours on. It's hard enough picking out an outfit for
the day.

The aim of this application is to provide a collection of color combinations to make your life a
little easier.

## Features
* Browse the most popular color combinations (from randoma11y's database)
* Select a color from the palette OR enter its hex/rgba/hsla code to view a list of other colors that 
pair well with it.

## Future
* Show a color's name instead of its hexcode.
* Allow customizable example text for the color combos.
* Integrate more color data for a more extensive collection.
